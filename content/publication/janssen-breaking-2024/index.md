abstract: 'Scholars increasingly raise concerns about the alleged detrimental impact
  of affective polarization on citizens’ democratic attitudes. Yet, prior studies
  on the relationship between affective polarization and democratic support have yielded
  mixed results: Whereas some scholars report evidence that affective polarization
  erodes citizens’ support for democracy, others report null-findings. In this research
  note, we posit that one relevant explanation for these mixed findings is that the
  relationship between affective polarization and democratic support is not linear,
  but rather negatively curvilinear (i.e., an inverted U-shape). Though extreme levels
  of affective polarization may harm citizens’ democratic commitments, a moderate
  amount of affective polarization can strengthen democratic support by heightening
  the political stakes and stimulating democratic involvement. Employing Generalized
  Additive Modelling on data from the CNEP collected in Germany, the UK, and the US,
  we show strong and robust support for this negatively curvilinear pattern. These
  findings have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics between
  affective polarization and democratic support, as well as for the recommended estimation
  strategies of future studies that aim to explore this relationship.'
