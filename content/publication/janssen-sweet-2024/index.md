abstract: Accepting defeat in the aftermath of elections is crucial for the stability
  of democracies. But in times of intense polarization, the voluntary consent of electoral
  losers seems less obvious. In this paper, I study whether affective and perceived
  ideological polarization amplify the winner–loser gap in political support. Using
  multilevel growth curve modelling on pre and post-election panel data from the British
  Election Study Internet Panel collected during the 2015 and 2019 UK general elections,
  I show that the winner–loser gap is indeed more pronounced amongst voters with higher
  levels of affective and perceived ideological polarization. Moreover, the results
  illustrate that polarized voters experience a stark decrease in their support for
  the political system following their electoral loss. Given the high and, in some
  Western democracies, rising polarization levels, these ﬁndings have important implications
  for losers’ consent and the stability of democracies in election times.
