abstract: Preschool education is regarded by many researchers and policymakers as
  a potential equalizer of educational opportunities. Yet, cross-national research
  shows that there exist large variations in the equalizing effects of preschool education
  across countries. In this paper, we study to what extent the national level of privatization
  of the preschool sector can explain these cross-national differences by examining
  its impact on the equalizing effects of preschool education. For this purpose, we
  use data from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2016 for 24 countries.
  The results show that having spent more time in preschool is more strongly associated
  with primary school achievements for children of disadvantaged families. We ﬁnd
  some modest support that this compensatory pattern—in which preschool compensates
  for a reduced set of resources in the home environment—is somewhat weaker in societies
  with higher levels of privatization, though not reaching conventional standards
  of statistical signiﬁcance. The study highlights the relevance of considering the
  impact of national preschool settings on the distribution of preschool beneﬁts across
  children with varying socioeconomic backgrounds.
